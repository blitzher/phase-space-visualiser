# phase-space-visualiser
This is a python script written in conjuction with LaTeX project surrounding differential equations and their numerical and analytical solutions

It is used for visualisiung the phase space (duh) for an arbitrary differential equation.

## Usage

Currently, to visualise a function, you will need to edit `main.py`. Change `dfun(x,y)` to your function, et voil√†. It saves an image of the last
screen shown to `plot.png` after closing the window.

Also only currently supports first order ODE's.
